## Starting the App

Run `npm i` to install dependencies first, and then run `ng s` to start the app.

Short description of the app

App has two pages:
- form-editor
- settings

The form-editor page demonstrates the main test task.
Additionally I've added settings page, to be able to setup some params for form-editor page.

Also I've installed @angular/cdk to be able to make a dropdown directive.

I didn't pay much of attention to the css. Just tried to make everything not very bad.

Finally, I didn't add the unit tests for the app, there was not any requirments about it.
